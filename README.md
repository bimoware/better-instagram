# Introduction
Instagram developpers don't make their web version good to attract people into their mobile version. This is pretty sad since this app has so much influence & potential yet is still greedy.

So I made my own prototype version of what Instagram should look like with all the potential it had.

Also, I have no life so might as well remake instagram

Right now, only the chat page is available & you can not interact with it (send messages, reply etc..) When i'll figure out sql databases. Maybe

# Installing
ðŸ‘‰ In your file explorer, go to a folder

ðŸ‘‰ Ctrl + Right-click & "Open in my terminal"
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget Ctrl

ðŸ‘‰ Copy past those two bad bois
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bimoware/better-instagram.git
